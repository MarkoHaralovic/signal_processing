## Course Description
In this course students gain fundamental signal processing knowledge with the aim of understanding the methods and the algorithms of digital signal processing.
Two most important topics are signal decomposition and filtering.
The following topics are covered: Signals. Classification of signals. Signal decomposition. Fourier transforms. Signal spectrum. Sampling and reconstruction. The sampling theorem. Window functions and spectral analysis. Discrete cosine transform. Systems. Classification of systems. Linear time invariant systems. The convolution sum. Laplace and Z transforms. Transfer function and frequency response. Equivalence of continuous and discrete systems. Euler and reversed Euler methods. Bilinear transform. Filtering, prediction and reconstruction of signals. Amplitude-selective filters. Filter design problem. Phase and group delay. Linear-phase systems. All-pass systems. Classification of digital filters. Computer aided design of amplitude-selective filters. Fast Fourier transform and its applications. Linear and circular convolution. Efficient computation of the convolution sum. Digital signal processor. Fixed-point arithmetic. Signal quantization.
